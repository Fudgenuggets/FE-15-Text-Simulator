# FE15-Text-Simulator

Simulates conversation using the assets from Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia. Includes character portraits, text boxes, and font. It is not 100% accurate to how it would appear in the game, but I tried to make it close to how it would be.
I'm also still new to github and this is basically my first actual project please don't hurt me.

To do:
- Fix font size and spacing
- Implement DLC portraits
- Implement blushing and sweatdrop if possible
